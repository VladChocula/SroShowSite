                                    Hi, my name is Steven 'VladChocula' Oliveira! Since 2011, I have been working in software development, initially starting in Quality Assurance in the
                                    videogame industry where I helped deliver games such as 'Medal of Honor: Warfighter', 'Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel', and 'Titanfall'.

                                <p class="about description">
                                    In the years since, I have continued to focus my efforts in Automation Engineering, Web Development, and Videogame Development. When i'm not staring at a text editor, you can find me with my nose buried in a book, brewing some home-made brandy,
                                    making world-class barbecue, playing games with friends, or building new experiences in Unreal Engine.
